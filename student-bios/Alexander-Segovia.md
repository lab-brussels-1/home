A very motivated student on his way to becoming an impressive future programmer.
I am 29 years old and come from El Salvador, Central America. My mother tongue
is Spanish and I also speak English and a little bit of Flemish. I moved to
Belgium on 2021 and I am really happy to start a coding career here.

**Some facts about me:**

✈️ Traveling is one of my favorite things in life

🏢 I like museums

🏃 Fitness life and healthy food are topics I am interested in

🐉 Pokemon Go is the game that drives me crazy!

🙇 I am an introverted person, but not an antisocial one at all!

_And finally, one phrase that describes me:_

> > "I am someone who likes trying and trying until a goal is accomplished"
