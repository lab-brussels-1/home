## _Meet Fenny_

An island monkey who turns to civilization to learn how to code and adulting. I've spent half of my life jumping from one island to the other island then make a bigger leap from one continent to the other (hence island monkey) :laughing: 

Because of this hopping lifestyle, i developed a hobby to travel, adoration to the history landmark, people culture, and photography.

Another activity which i mostly do for pleasure when i'm not working on something is sketching/drawing, and board gaming.
