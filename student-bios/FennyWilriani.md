## _Meet Fenny_

An island monkey who turns to civilization to learn how to code and adult-ing. I've spent half of my life jumping from one island to the other island then make a bigger leap from one continent to the other (hence island monkey) :laughing:

Because of this hopping lifestyle, i developed a hobby to travel, adoration to the history landmark, people culture, photography, and mostly trying **_traditional food_** from each country i've traveled to.

Another activity which i mostly do for pleasure when i'm not working on something is sketching/drawing, and board gaming.

## _Professionally_

I worked as an event and community manager, program coordinator, marketing & communication team for several start up company based in UK and Bali, Indonesia.

Working with start ups allowed me to get surface-level experience in most digital marketing channels, and has helped me find my interest in data analysis, and web design.

>_A quick reminder to self whenever i stuck with the new challenge._
