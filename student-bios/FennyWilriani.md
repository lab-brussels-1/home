# Fenny Wilriani Jacobs

## _Meet Fenny_

An island monkey who turns to civilization to learn how to code and adulting. I've spent half of my life jumping from one island to the other island then make a bigger leap from one continent to the other (hence island monkey) :laughing:

Because of this hopping lifestyle, i developed a hobby to travel, adoration to the history landmark, people culture, and photography.

Another activity which i mostly do for pleasure when i'm not working on something is sketching/drawing, and board gaming.

## _Professionally_

I had experience working as an event & community manager, program coordinator, part of marketing communication team for several start up company based in UK and Bali, Indonesia.

Working in a small startup had allow me to get surface-level experience in most digital marketing channels. Now, I would like to deep-dive and gain advanced know-how in creating and operating the systems.
