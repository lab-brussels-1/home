# I love modern `ART`. I am for `PEACE`. I learn `CODING`.

My name is Maria.:wave:  
I was born in Kazakhstan and raised in Russia.  
I have a degree in engineering business and management.:mortar_board:  
My passion is constantly learning new things. Among the things I studied are stained glass art, interior design, project management, snowboarding, languages, piano, tennis, driving and etc. Six years ago I moved to Belgium following my husband assignment. The same year I had my daughter. Since then, my time management and stress resistance have improved significantly :smile:
