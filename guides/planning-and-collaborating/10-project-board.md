# Project Board

If your team did a good job writing your Development Strategy, setting up your
Project Board should be easy - pretty much copy-pasting.

## Labels

Create one _**label**_ for each _must have_ user story and for each type of
task.

You can always create new labels during development, so no worries if you forget
one now.

## Issues

Create one _**issue**_ for each task in your Development Strategy. A task in
your Dev Strategy is a single bullet point. Be sure each issue has:

- _labels_ to tell what types of work are included in this task
- a _milestone_ to know where the issue belongs in the timeline of development
- a checklist to track your progress on this task

## Columns

Finally, create your project board and add these columns:

1. **TODO**: Claimed and unclaimed issues that no one is actively working on.
2. **DOING** Tasks someone is actively working on. Use the `help-wanted` label
   in this column if you are blocked.
3. **READY FOR REVIEW**: Issues with a linked PR to review. If changes are
   requested you can move the issue back to _Todo_ or _Doing_.
4. **NEEDS REVISION**: PRs that were reviewed and are not ready to merge. If
   this is your PR you can move it back to _Doing_ when you're ready to fix it.
5. **DONE**: Issues that have been closed for any reason including: the linked
   PR was merged, the discussion has finished, or the task is no longer
   necessary.

When your columns are ready, move all of your issues into the _**Todo**_ column
and you're ready to go!
