# Repository Setup

Before diving into your project make sure your team has all the practical things
in place. This step isn't very hard and will be basically the same for every
project, it will become habit.

## Create and Share a Repository

As a team you will choose the name for your project's repository and select
someone from your team to be the repo owner. This person will create a new
repository from the template \(or an empty one if you're not using a template\):

- The Basics
  - Use the name your team decided on
  - Turn on GitHub Pages and set your live URL as the Website in your
    repository's About section
  - Turn on Discussions in your repository
- Collaboration Settings
  - Add everyone in your team as a contributor with _Admin_ access
  - Require a code review for PRs to `main`/`master`
    \([owanateamachree](https://owanateamachree.medium.com/how-to-protect-the-master-branch-on-github-ab85e9b6b03),
    [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews)\)
    - You will need to type `main` or `master` into the _Branch name pattern_
      input box \(depending on which on what your repo's default branch is
      named\)
    - Select _Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed_
- Create your group project issue in the Class Repository and assign all your
  team members

## Milestones

Create 5 milestones in your repository:

- **planning**
- **must-have**, **should-have**, **could-have**
- **retrospective**

## Planning Folder

Create a folder called `/planning` where your team will store all documents
related to planning the project \(if you're not using an HYF template\)

## Code of Conduct

A code of conduct sets the expectation that everyone contributing to your
project will treat each other with respect, and what happens if they do not.
There are many Codes of Conduct already available online, you can learn more
about them from:

- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
- [opensourceconduct.com](https://opensourceconduct.com/)
- [opensourcedesign.net](https://opensourcedesign.net/code-of-conduct/)
- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)

## Contributor Guidelines

Contributor Guidelines are important to standardize coding practices and
workflows for an Open Source project. You could think of it as describing how
the code should be treated:
