All done :\)

Your team has either finished the project ahead of time, or the deadline has
arrived and you're still not finished. No problem either way!

A retrospective is meant for looking back at how the project went and learning
what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a great
retrospective is still a success.

## Behaviors, not People!

Focus on what your group can _do_ that will make the next sprint better. A huge
list of things to stop doing doesn't help you move forward.

Retrospectives are all about behaviors that can be changed, not people that need
fixing. Keep your retrospectives _positive_ and _general_. **_You should NEVER
mention people by name!!!_**

## Strategy vs. Board

Take some time as a group to compare your Development Strategy to your Project
Board.

- What parts of your plan went as expected?
- What parts of your plan did not work out?
- Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
- Or remove extra steps?

## The Four Points

Your group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three
questions. You can have more than one answer! You can answer with bullet points,
paragraphs, links, images ... whatever is most clear.

- **Stop Doing**: what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your
  communication have been better? be specific!
- **Continue Doing**: what went well that you should continue doing in the next
  project? be specific!
- **Start Doing**: any good ideas you'd like to try out in the next project? be
  specific!
- **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team
  learned? This can be about anything, not just code!

## Template
