# Typical Week

Throughout the HYF course and your overall career as a programmer, you will
_control your own fate_. 35 hours of study is just the bare minimum to get by at
HYF, not enough to fully prepare you for your first job.

The more you know and the harder you work, the faster you will find yourself in
a career you love.

The more you participate and become part of the HYF community, the more people
are going to be willing to help you in return.

## Using this Repo

Here are 5 tips for using issues in this repository:

### Help Wanted

- **The Template**: If you're blocked on something in an assignment or
  self-study you can use the `help-wanted` template to create a new issue and
  ask for help.
- **The Label**: You can attach the `help-wanted` label to any issue or PR that
  you need help completing. If the code you are blocked on is in another
  repository, you can create a new issue using the `help-wanted` template to
  describe your problem and link to your code.

### Question

- **The Template** Got a question about anything? Go ahead and ask! You can use
  create a new issue using the `question` template to ask your question in a
  clear and structured way.
- **The Label**: Or add the `question` label to any other issue! This can help
  be helpful for searching check-ins or deliverables.

### Check-Ins

> template + label

Each module you will create a new check-in issue. You will use this issue to
keep track of your self-study progress, and to post a check-in comment for each
chapter including:

- **I need help with**
- **What Went Well**
- **What Went Less Well**
- **Lessons Learned**
- **Prep Work** (for the next chapter)

### Deliverable

> template + label

For each project/exercise/assignment (individual or group) you will place a new
issue on the Class Projects board.

- If you are blocked, add the `help-wanted` label
- When you think you're finished, move your issue into the Ready for Review
  column
  - If your assignment is complete, a coach will move it into the Done column
  - Else they will move it to Needs Revision. When you've addressed the feedback
    you can move it back into Ready for Review

### Roll-Calls

Each Sunday before class your coach will create a new Roll Call issue. Leave a
little comment to say hello and let us all know how your week went.
