## HYF Be Curriculum: a Spider Web

It's helpful to imagine the HYF Be curriculum as a spider web with two types of
thread:

- **Skills**: The lines going out from the center represent the skills you will
  practice each and every week.
- **Technologies**: The circles going out from the center represent the
  languages and technologies you will learn in each module.

The _Workflows_ modules starts in the center of this spider's web. You will
already be practicing all of the skills but with projects that use only
Markdown. Because Markdown is small and simple you will be free to focus on more
important things like communication and code review.

After you have practiced working on full group projects written in markdown, you
will expand to the second circle with the _Agile Development_ module. This is
when you learn how to collaboratively plan and develop web pages written with
HTML and CSS. You will continue practicing all of the skills you learned in
_Workflows_, only now the programming languages will be more complex.

... and so on, forever! HYF is just the beginning. Your web will continue to
grow after you graduate from HYF as you practice the skills in your web and add
rings of new languages and technologies.

## You are in Control

Throughout your HYF journey and your overall career as a programmer, you will be
responsible for your own learning. 25-30 hours of study is just the minimum we
suggest. The more time you spend and the better you study, the faster you will
find yourself in a job you love. The more you participate and become part of the
HYF community, the more friends you will make, and the more people will want to
help you.

This is not a race against the curriculum or a race against other students. It's
a marathon to a new career, and no one is giving you a rank.

## Collaboration vs. Cheating

Collaborating is encouraged, cheating is not tolerated. There is a large
difference between stealing and collaboration, even if the end result looks the
same (you and another student have the same code). If we find two or more
homework assignments with the same code we will check in with everyone involved
to see if this was collaborative work or cheating:

- **Collaboration** is when you ask each other for help or for explanations, you
  voluntarily share code, and take the time to explain/understand what has been
  shared.
- **Cheating** is when you copy someone‚Äôs code to complete the homeworks without
  taking to the time to understand it, without letting them know, or without
  them explaining why they wrote what they did.

At HYF you will not be getting grades on every exercise, so if you cheat you're
only cheating yourself!
