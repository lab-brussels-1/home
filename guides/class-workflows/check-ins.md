# Check-Ins

You will be required to post a check-in comment each week in your module
`check-in` issue.

These check-ins are how you will keep track of your progress on your individual
study. Coaches, peers and HYF team will read your check-in to know how we can
help supporting you. Coaches will also use your Wednesday Check-Ins to prepare
for the evening review call. Please include:

- _Check Boxes_: started the exercises, link to project issue \(if there is a
  project that week\)
- **I Need Help with**: What are you having trouble understanding? What parts of
  the homework are you struggling to complete?
- **What went well?**: What has been successful so far? have you learned and/or
  completed so far this week?
- **What went less well?**: What mistakes did you and/or your group make? What
  was difficult?
- **Lessons Learned**: What did you learn this week that you will take with you
  into next week? I can be technical, a mindset, a study habit, anything!
- **Sunday Prep Work**: Begin organizing your prep work for the following
  Sunday.

When you have posted your Wednesday Check-in comment please add the `chapter-x`
label to your issue, so we know it's ready for review.

After reading your check-in, a coach or HYF team member will label it
`checked-x`.
